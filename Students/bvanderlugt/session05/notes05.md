notes from homework:
Cany you create expections from generic errors? Any errors? or do you have to specify the builtin expection that you want to flag?

Reviewing session 04:

General exception handling in all languages: only catch an exception if you are
going to improve the world. Kind of like only catch exceptions that the code can help improve. If an exception is beyond the scope of a code chunk let a
higher encapsulating try-exception exception handler take care of it.
