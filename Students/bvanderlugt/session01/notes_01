*Questions*
-Office hours? A: Sat morning via interwebz
-Reviewing HW material

type(size) means "what is the type of the value currently held in 
variable 'size'"

Keywords = special reserved words
Built-in function =  just a function that has been defined 
'out of the box'
-print is weird...a keyword in python2 and a built-in variable in 
python

Object Oriented Programming
-"interveiw q": what is oop?
- the shitt answer is: "inherited polymorphism"
-the thing that makes it valuable? objects gibe you virtual entities that you 
can abstract like real objects
- the car example: car object, and driver object. You can model meaningful
intuitive objects of the real world. tired driver, shitty stopping car 
- interesting aspects come from "emergent" interactions...the relationship
between objects revealing relationships

Base off question: "How to determine when your objects are 
scoped appropriately"

**hueristic** rule of thumb for breaking up code:

*single responsibility principle*: A unit of code should do one thing and 
do it well...a function, should do one thing and do it well...a package,
should do one thing, and do it well...
ex. a method: "render and print" -- bad, do one thing
good -- "render" and then "print"

encapsulation = a method that keeps you from messing with things you 
shouldn't mess with

method is bound to an object
function is a block a code you can call that returns a value

dir(something) = how you figure out the methods associated with anything

double underscore thing double underscore =  special methods for contexts
